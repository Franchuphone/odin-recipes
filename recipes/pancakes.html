    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy pancake recipe doesn't require much thought early in the morning and the pancakes taste great!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This quick pancake recipe starts with a cup of all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>Sugar: You’ll need two tablespoons of white sugar. </li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavening agent, ensuring perfectly fluffy pancakes. </li>
        <li>Salt: Salt enhances the overall flavor of the pancakes, but it won’t make the pancakes taste salty. </li>
        <li>Milk and oil: Milk and oil add moisture and flavor to the pancake batter. </li>
        <li>Egg: A beaten egg lends more moisture and helps bind the batter together. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth. </li>
        <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
    </ol>
